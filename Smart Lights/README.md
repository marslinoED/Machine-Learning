Arduino Smart Lights Project 💡⚡
Sorry for the video quality, I don't have a night camera.
I created a Smart Lights project,
where my laptop connects to the Arduino port to send it the output of a Python program,
that reads the movie and sends the primary colors in each scene to the Arduino,
which outputs them based on the electrical charges in the RGB LED so that the movie becomes more interactive. 🍿🎥

I added many hyperparameters in the project so that each film can design its best characteristics to send the correct colors, 🔴🟢🔵
such as the number of colors from the screen that it will choose from, to make the right decision.
And how many milliseconds will send the color to the Arduino so that the change is not too much.
